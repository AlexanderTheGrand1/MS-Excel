Task One (Data Cleaning):

In the movie dataset I did the following steps,

1.       I started to record each of my steps in Macro

2.       I first made a copy of the worksheet

3.       I Arranged the columns and grouped the similar data together for better understanding.

4.       Then I searched for any of the columns that were unnecessary for the analysis

5.       Then I searched for Duplicates with conditional formatting where I found that title_year column has a duplicate column and there are double entry of Avengers: Age of Ultron?ÿ and I deleted it after understanding that both data are same.

6.       Then I manipulated the column size for better visibility.

7.       I saw that movie tiles and it had “? Ÿ” so I used LEFT(string, LEN(string) - 1) and removed it and replaced the original column.

8.       I find also double quotes in the values, so I used Replace function to delete only the quotes.

Task Two (Data Visualization):

In the Employee_Salaries.xlsx I have created Dashboards with the following Graphs that includes.

1.       A map of the gross pay by zip code

2.       A bar chart of gross pay by gender

3.       A bar chart of gross pay by number of years being hired

4.       A tree map of overtime pay and department name

5.       Average annual salary

6.       Maximum gross pays by an employee

7.       Number of Employees
